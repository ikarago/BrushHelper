# BrushHelper
A Brush Helper to make selecting the right brush for UWP-apps a bit easier.


## Get the app
The project was never released in the Microsoft Store, so the only way to get the app is by cloning this repo and build it yourself.
All you'll need to build is:
* Visual Studio
* UWP SDK of anything from version 16299 or higher
* this repository.


## Supported Windows versions
**Minimal suppored version:** 16299 (Fall Creators Update)

**Target version:** 16299 (Fall Creators Update)

**Currently supported systems:**
The app was designed to be used with Windows 10 Desktop only, due to its nature of being a development tool.

* Windows 10 Desktop ✔
* Windows 10 Mobile ❌
* Windows 10 Team ❌
* Windows 10 Holographic ❌
* Windows 10 Xbox ❌


## Notes
I don't plan to work on this project anymore, as this is a legacy app. I uploaded this for archival purposes and as reference work for other UWP apps.
